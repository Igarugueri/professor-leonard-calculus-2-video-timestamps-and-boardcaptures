● [0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1). Introduction to Comparison Tests.
     ◉ We will study two comparison tests:
          ○ the Direct Comparison Test.
          ○ the Limit Comparison Test.
     ◉ Main idea:
          ○ compare an unknown series with a known series.
     ◉ Usually, the known series will be:
          ○ a geometric series.
          ○ a 𝒑-series.
          ○ the harmonic series.

● [1:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=74). Fundamental idea.
     ◉ Compare one series to another series whose convergence or divergence is already known.
     ◉ The goal is to use the known series to decide the behavior of the unknown series.
     ◉ Typical known series:
          ○ geometric series.
          ○ 𝒑-series.
          ○ harmonic series.

● [2:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=133). Requirement for comparison tests.
     ◉ Suppose we have two series:
          ○ ∑ 𝒂ₙ
          ○ ∑ 𝒃ₙ
     ◉ **🟩Both series must have positive terms:🟩**
          ○ 𝒂ₙ ≥ 0
          ○ 𝒃ₙ ≥ 0
     ◉ This is essential because the comparison is based on term-by-term size.

● [3:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=186). The Direct Comparison Test.
     ◉ The idea is to compare the terms directly:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ ≤ 𝒃ₙ
     ◉ Meaning:
          ○ every term of 𝒂ₙ is less than or equal to the corresponding term of 𝒃ₙ.
     ◉ There are two useful scenarios:
          ○ proving convergence.
          ○ proving divergence.

● [3:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=201). Scenario 1 — Proving convergence. [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4/[3-21]-01.png)
     ◉ Suppose:
          ○ 0 ≤ 𝒂ₙ ≤ 𝒃ₙ
     ◉  i̲f̲  ∑ 𝒃ₙ converges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ ∑ 𝒂ₙ also converges.
     ◉ Reason:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ is smaller than 𝒃ₙ term by term.
          ○  i̲f̲  the larger positive series has a finite sum,
               ■ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the smaller positive series must also have a finite sum.
               
● [4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=257). Scenario 1 — Main convergence principle.
     ◉  i̲f̲  the bigger series converges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the smaller series also converges.
     ◉ Symbolically:
          ○ 0 ≤ 𝒂ₙ ≤ 𝒃ₙ
          ○ ∑ 𝒃ₙ converges
          ○ therefore, ∑ 𝒂ₙ converges.

● [5:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=358). Scenario 1 — Inconclusive convergence case.
     ◉  i̲f̲  0 ≤ 𝒂ₙ ≤ 𝒃ₙ a̲n̲d̲  ∑ 𝒃ₙ diverges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ we cannot conclude anything about ∑ 𝒂ₙ.
     ◉ Reason:
          ○ being smaller than a divergent series does not force convergence or divergence.
          ○ the smaller series could converge or diverge.

● [7:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=469). Scenario 2 — Proving divergence. [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4/[7-49]-01.png)
     ◉ Suppose:
          ○ 0 ≤ 𝒃ₙ ≤ 𝒂ₙ
     ◉  i̲f̲ ∑ 𝒃ₙ diverges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ ∑ 𝒂ₙ also diverges.
     ◉ Reason:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ is larger than 𝒃ₙ term by term.
          ○ if the smaller positive series already diverges,
               ■ then the larger positive series must also diverge.

● [8:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=535). Scenario 2 — Main divergence principle.
     ◉  i̲f̲ the smaller series diverges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the bigger series also diverges.
     ◉ Symbolically:
          ○ 0 ≤ 𝒃ₙ ≤ 𝒂ₙ
          ○ ∑ 𝒃ₙ diverges
          ○ therefore, ∑ 𝒂ₙ diverges.

● [9:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=573). Scenario 2 — Inconclusive divergence case.
     ◉ i̲f̲  0 ≤ 𝒃ₙ ≤ 𝒂ₙ  a̲n̲d̲  ∑ 𝒃ₙ converges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ we cannot conclude anything about ∑ 𝒂ₙ.
     ◉ Reason:
          ○ being bigger than a convergent series does not force convergence or divergence.
          ○ the bigger series could converge or diverge.

● N̲O̲T̲E̲ — Direct Comparison Test summary.
     ◉ To prove convergence:
          ○ compare the given series to a bigger convergent series.
          ○ smaller than convergent ⇒ convergent.
     ◉ To prove divergence:
          ○ compare the given series to a smaller divergent series.
          ○ bigger than divergent ⇒ divergent.
     ◉ Inconclusive cases:
          ○ smaller than divergent ⇒ inconclusive.
          ○ bigger than convergent ⇒ inconclusive.

● [10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=632). Methodology and progression of tests.
     ◉ First step:
          ○ always check the Divergence Test.
     ◉ Then check whether the series is:
          ○ geometric.
          ○ a 𝒑-series.
          ○ suitable for the Integral Test.
          ○ suitable for the Direct Comparison Test.
          ○ suitable for the Limit Comparison Test.

● [10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=644). First essential step — Divergence Test.
     ◉ Always begin by checking:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ
     ◉  i̲f̲  limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ ≠ 0
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ ∑ 𝒂ₙ diverges immediately.
     ◉  i̲f̲  limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ = 0
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the test is inconclusive. Continue with another test.

● [11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=682). Choosing between tests.
     ◉ After the Divergence Test:
          ○ check whether the series is geometric.
          ○ check whether the series is a 𝒑-series.
          ○ check whether the Integral Test is practical.
          ○ check whether a comparison test is easier.
     ◉ Main idea:
          ○ do not make the problem harder than necessary.

     ◉ First check the Divergence Test:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 1/(𝒏² + 2) = 0
     ◉ Since the limit is 0:
          ○ the Divergence Test is inconclusive.
          ○ we continue.
     ◉ [11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=682). Check whether the Integral Test is practical.
          ○ The Integral Test could be used here,
               ■ but there is an easier way.
          ○ Since the series looks very close to a 𝒑-series,
               ■ Direct Comparison is more convenient.
     ◉ [12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=725). Choosing a comparison series for Example 1.
          ○ The expression looks similar to:
               ■ 1/𝒏²
          ○ Since:
               ■ 𝒏² + 2 > 𝒏²
          ○ Then:
               ■ 1/(𝒏² + 2) < 1/𝒏² for all n ≥ 1
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ 0 ≤ 1/(𝒏² + 2) ≤ 1/𝒏² and **🟩 both series have positive terms.🟩**
     ◉ Known behavior of the comparison series.
          ○ The comparison series is:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/𝒏²
          ○ This is a 𝒑-series with:
               ■ 𝒑 = 2
          ○ Since:
               ■ 2 > 1
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/𝒏² converges.
     ◉ Conclusion for Example 1.
          ○ Since:
               ■ 0 ≤ 1/(𝒏² + 2) ≤ 1/𝒏²
          ○ And:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/𝒏² converges,
          ○ By the Direct Comparison Test:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/(𝒏² + 2) converges.

● [16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1015). 🧩 Example 2 — Analyzing ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/(2ⁿ + 3). [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4/[16-55]-01.png)
     ◉ First check the Divergence Test:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 1/(2ⁿ + 3) = 0
     ◉ Since the limit is 0:
          ○ the Divergence Test is inconclusive.
          ○ we continue.
     ◉ [17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1055). Choosing a comparison series.
          ○ The +3 in the denominator makes the fraction smaller.
          ○ Since:
               ■ 2ⁿ + 3 > 2ⁿ
          ○ Then:
               ■ 1/(2ⁿ + 3) < 1/2ⁿ
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ 0 ≤ 1/(2ⁿ + 3) ≤ 1/2ⁿ and **🟩both series have positive terms.🟩**
     ◉ [20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1244). Comparison with a geometric series.
          ○ Rewrite:
               ■ 1/2ⁿ = (1/2)ⁿ
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/2ⁿ = ∑[𝒏=1,∞] (1/2)ⁿ
          ○ This is a geometric series with:
               ■ 𝒓 = 1/2
          ○ Since:
               ■ |𝒓| = 1/2 < 1
          ○ The geometric series converges.
     ◉ [23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1421). Conclusion for Example 2.
          ○ Since:
               ■ 0 ≤ 1/(2ⁿ + 3) ≤ 1/2ⁿ
          ○ And:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/2ⁿ converges,
          ○ By the Direct Comparison Test:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/(2ⁿ + 3) converges.
          ○ Important:
               ■ we do not need the exact sum of the geometric series.
               ■ we only need to know that it converges.

     ◉ Given series:
          ○ ∑[𝒏=3,∞] 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4)
     ◉ First check positivity:
          ○ the series starts at 𝒏 = 3.
          ○ for 𝒏 ≥ 3, 2ⁿ - 4 > 0.
          ○ therefore, the terms are positive.
     ◉ Important:
          ○ the starting index matters here.
          ○ if 𝒏 = 2, the denominator would be 0.
     ◉ [28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1701). Comparison with a geometric series.
          ○ Compare:
               ■ 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) and 3ⁿ/2ⁿ
          ○ Since:
               ■ 2ⁿ - 4 < 2ⁿ
          ○ Then:
               ■ 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) > 3ⁿ/2ⁿ
          ○ Rewrite:
               ■ 3ⁿ/2ⁿ = (3/2)ⁿ
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) > (3/2)ⁿ
     ◉ [29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=1765). Known behavior of the comparison series.
          ○ The comparison series is:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=3,∞] (3/2)ⁿ
          ○ This is a geometric series with:
               ■ 𝒓 = 3/2
          ○ Since:
               ■ |𝒓| = 3/2 > 1
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=3,∞] (3/2)ⁿ diverges.
● Finite terms do not affect convergence.
          ○ Convergence or divergence is not changed by:
               ■ adding finitely many terms.
               ■ subtracting finitely many terms.
               ■ changing the starting index by a finite amount.
          ○ The sum may change,
               ■ but the convergence behavior does not change.
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ starting at 𝒏 = 3 does not affect whether the geometric series converges or diverges.
     ◉ Conclusion.
          ○ Since:
               ■ 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) > (3/2)ⁿ
          ○ And:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=3,∞] (3/2)ⁿ diverges,
          ○ By the Direct Comparison Test:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=3,∞] 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) diverges.
     ◉ [35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2130).  Alternative check using the Divergence Test.
          ○ The given term is:
               ■ 𝒂ₙ = 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4)
          ○ The limit does not go to 0.
          ○ In fact:
               ■ the dominant behavior is like (3/2)ⁿ
               ■ and (3/2)ⁿ → ∞
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ limₙ→∞ 3ⁿ/(2ⁿ - 4) ≠ 0
          ○ So the series also diverges by the Divergence Test.
          ○ Important:
               ■ this should usually be checked first.

● [37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2228). 🧩 Example 4 — The failure of Direct Comparison: ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/(√𝒏 + 1). [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4/[37-08]-01.png)
     ◉ Given series:
          ○ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/(√𝒏 + 1)
     ◉ First check positivity:
          ○ all terms are positive.
     ◉ Compare with:
          ○ 1/√𝒏
     ◉ Since:
          ○ √𝒏 + 1 > √𝒏
     ◉ Then:
          ○ 1/(√𝒏 + 1) < 1/√𝒏
     ◉ [38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2327). Why Direct Comparison does not conclude divergence here.
          ○ The comparison series is:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/√𝒏
          ○ Rewrite:
               ■ 1/√𝒏 = 1/𝒏¹ᐟ²
          ○ This is a 𝒑-series with:
               ■ 𝒑 = 1/2
          ○ Since:
               ■ 1/2 ≤ 1
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 1/√𝒏 diverges.
          ○ But we only know:
               ■ 1/(√𝒏 + 1) < 1/√𝒏
          ○ This means:
               ■ the given series is smaller than a divergent series.
          ○ This is inconclusive:
               ■ smaller than divergent ⇒ inconclusive.

● [41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2462). The Limit Comparison Test.
     ◉ i̲f̲ Direct Comparison is inconclusive,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲ try the Limit Comparison Test.
     ◉ Inconclusive cases:
          ○ smaller than divergent ⇒ inconclusive.
          ○ bigger than convergent ⇒ inconclusive.
     ◉ Main idea:
          ○ we compare our given series to a series whose convergence or divergence we already know,
          ○ and then we take a limit.
     ◉ This test is especially useful when two series have similar end behavior.

● Definition of the Limit Comparison Test.
     ◉ Suppose:
          ○ ∑ 𝒂ₙ and ∑ 𝒃ₙ have positive terms.
     ◉ Compute:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ
     ◉ i̲f̲ the limit exists a̲n̲d̲ is a finite positive number: 0 < 𝑳 < ∞
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲  ∑ 𝒂ₙ a̲n̲d̲ ∑ 𝒃ₙ have the same convergence behavior.
     ◉ Meaning:
          ○ they either both converge,
          ○ or they both diverge.

● [43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2620). Meaning of the limit in the LCT.
     ◉ The ratio:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ
     ◉ measures how close the two series are term by term.
     ◉ If the ratio approaches a finite positive number,
          ○ the terms behave similarly as 𝒏 → ∞.
     ◉ Therefore:
          ○ one series predicts the behavior of the other.

● [43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2620). Formal proof idea.
     ◉ i̲f̲  limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ = 𝑳
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲, by the definition of a limit:
               ■ |𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ - 𝑳| < ε𝑳
     ◉ Rewrite the absolute value inequality:
          ○ -ε𝑳 < 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ - 𝑳 < ε𝑳
     ◉ Add 𝑳 to every part:
          ○ 𝑳 - ε𝑳 < 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ < 𝑳 + ε𝑳
     ◉ Factor out 𝑳:
          ○ (1 - ε)𝑳 < 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ < (1 + ε)𝑳
     ◉ Since 𝒃ₙ > 0, multiply every part by 𝒃ₙ:
          ○ (1 - ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ < 𝒂ₙ < (1 + ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ
     ◉ Key interpretation:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ is trapped between two positive constant multiples of 𝒃ₙ.
          ○ therefore, 𝒂ₙ and 𝒃ₙ must have the same convergence behavior.

● [47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2820). How the inequality proves convergence.
     ◉ From the right side of the inequality:
          ○ 𝒂ₙ < (1 + ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ
     ◉ i̲f̲  ∑ 𝒃ₙ converges,
          ○ t̲h̲e̲n̲  ∑ (1 + ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ also converges,
               ■ because multiplying by a positive constant does not change convergence.
     ◉ Since 𝒂ₙ is smaller than a convergent positive series,
          ○ ∑ 𝒂ₙ also converges.

● [47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2820). How the inequality proves divergence.
     ◉ From the left side of the inequality:
          ○ (1 - ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ < 𝒂ₙ
     ◉ i̲f̲  ∑ 𝒃ₙ diverges,
          ○+ t̲h̲e̲n̲  ∑ (1 - ε)𝑳 ⋅ 𝒃ₙ also diverges,
               ■ because multiplying by a positive constant does not change divergence.
     ◉ Since 𝒂ₙ is bigger than a divergent positive series,

     ◉ If the LCT limit exists,
          ○ this does not automatically mean the series converges.
     ◉ It means:
          ○ the given series and the comparison series have the same behavior.
     ◉ Therefore:
          ○ if the comparison series converges,
               ■ the given series converges.
          ○ if the comparison series diverges,

● [49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=2943). Decision map for choosing series tests.
     ◉ Step 1 — Always start with the Divergence Test.
          ○ take the limit of the general term:
               ■ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ
          ○ i̲f̲ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ ≠ 0,
               ■ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the series diverges.
               ■ stop immediately.
          ○ i̲f̲ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ = 0,
               ■ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the test is inconclusive.
               ■ continue with another test.
     ◉ Step 2 — Check the easy known series.
          ○ Is it geometric?
               ■ i̲f̲ yes, use the Geometric Series Test.
          ○ Is it a 𝒑-series?
               ■ i̲f̲ yes, use the 𝒑-Series Test.
          ○ Is it harmonic or similar to harmonic?
               ■ i̲f̲ yes, use the known behavior of the harmonic series.
     ◉ Step 3 — Consider the Integral Test.
          ○ Ask:
               ■ can the terms be represented by a function 𝒇(𝒙)?
          ○ Check whether 𝒇(𝒙) is:
               ■ positive,
               ■ continuous,
               ■ decreasing.
          ○ i̲f̲ these conditions hold,
               ■ t̲h̲e̲n̲ the Integral Test may work well.
     ◉ Step 4 — Try the Direct Comparison Test.
          ○ To prove convergence:
               ■ check whether the given series is smaller than a known convergent series.
               ■ smaller than convergent ⇒ convergent.
          ○ To prove divergence:
               ■ check whether the given series is bigger than a known divergent series.
               ■ bigger than divergent ⇒ divergent.
     ◉ Step 5 — Recognize when Direct Comparison is inconclusive.
          ○ smaller than divergent ⇒ inconclusive.
          ○ bigger than convergent ⇒ inconclusive.
          ○ in these cases,
               ■ Direct Comparison does not give enough information.
     ◉ Step 6 — Try the Limit Comparison Test.
          ○ Use this when the given series has similar end behavior to a known series.
          ○ Choose a known comparison series:
               ■ usually geometric,
               ■ or a 𝒑-series,
               ■ or harmonic-type.
          ○ Compute:
               ■ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ/𝒃ₙ
          ○ i̲f̲ this limit exists and is a finite positive number,
               ■ t̲h̲e̲n̲ both series have the same convergence behavior.
               ■ they both converge or they both diverge.

     ◉ A sequence is a list of terms:
          ○ 𝒂₁, 𝒂₂, 𝒂₃, ...
     ◉ A series is the sum of those terms:
          ○ ∑[𝒏=1,∞] 𝒂ₙ

     ◉ A series converges when:
          ○ the infinite sum approaches a finite number.
     ◉ This does not mean:
          ○ the terms add to 0.
     ◉ It means:
          ○ the terms become small enough that the total sum stabilizes.
     ◉ Necessary condition:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ = 0
     ◉ But:
          ○ limₙ→∞ 𝒂ₙ = 0 does not guarantee convergence.

     ◉ When using the Limit Comparison Test,
          ○ choose a comparison series based on end behavior.
     ◉ End behavior means:
          ○ **the dominant part of the expression as 𝒏 → ∞.**
     ◉ For rational expressions:
          ○ keep the leading terms.
     ◉ For radicals:
          ○ keep the dominant term inside the radical.
     ◉ For sums in the numerator:
          ○ keep the fastest-growing term.

     ◉ Example:
          ○ √(4𝒏⁷ + 3) behaves like √(4𝒏⁷).
     ◉ Therefore:
          ○ (2𝒏² + 𝒏)/√(4𝒏⁷ + 3)
     ◉ behaves like:
          ○ 2𝒏²/√(4𝒏⁷)

          ○ so the Divergence Test is inconclusive.
     ◉ Use Limit Comparison based on end behavior.

● [1:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei8WKMAHky0&t=3971). Finding the comparison series.
     ◉ End behavior of the numerator:
          ○ 2𝒏² + 𝒏 behaves like 2𝒏².
     ◉ End behavior of the denominator:
          ○ √(4𝒏⁷ + 3) behaves like √(4𝒏⁷).
     ◉ Therefore, compare with:
          ○ 2𝒏²/√(4𝒏⁷)
     ◉ Simplify:
          ○ 2𝒏²/√(4𝒏⁷) = 2𝒏²/(2𝒏⁷ᐟ²)

     ◉ We need the dominant term.
     ◉ Compare:
          ○ √𝒏
          ○ ln(𝒏)
     ◉ √𝒏 **grows faster** than ln(𝒏).
          ○ The fastest-growing part is the one that determines the **end behavior as 𝒏 → ∞.**
