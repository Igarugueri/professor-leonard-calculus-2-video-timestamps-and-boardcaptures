● [0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=1). Intro𝒅𝒖ction to inverse trigonometric functions and fundamental properties.
     ◉ One-to-one requirement: a function must be injective to have an inverse.
          ○ A function is injective if different inputs always pro𝒅𝒖ce different outputs.
               ■ This guarantees that each value in the range corresponds to exactly one value in the domain.
               ■ Without injectivity, an inverse function would be ambiguous (one output mapping to multiple inputs).
          ○ Need for domain restriction in periodic trigonometric functions.
               ■ Trigonometric functions like sin, cos, and tan are periodic and repeat values infinitely many times.
               ■ Restricting the domain removes this repetition and forces the function to be one-to-one.
               ■ The chosen restricted interval is called the principal interval and defines the principal values of the inverse.

     ◉ Key graphical properties.
          ○ The sine function is periodic and oscillates between −1 and 1.
          ○ It fails the **horizontal line test** on ℝ, so it is not one-to-one on its full domain.
     ◉ Restricting the domain to the interval [−π/2, π/2] to ensure injectivity.
          ○ We restrict the domain so that the inverse is a function.
          ○ On this interval, sin(𝒙) is strictly increasing.
          ○ Every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.
     ◉ Formal definition:
          ○ 𝒚 = sin⁻¹(𝒙) if and only if sin(𝒚) = 𝒙.
               ■ Here, 𝒚 is restricted to the principal interval [−π/2, π/2].
     ◉ Interchange principle.
          ○ The original domain [−π/2, π/2] becomes the range of the inverse function.
          ○ The original range [−1, 1] becomes the domain of the inverse.
     ◉ Final specification for sin⁻¹(𝒙).

     ◉ Key graphical properties.
          ○ The cosine function is periodic and oscillates between −1 and 1.
          ○ On its full domain ℝ, it fails the horizontal line test.
     ◉ Selection of the interval [0, π] to make the function one-to-one.
          ○ On the interval [0, π], cos(𝒙) is strictly decreasing.
          ○ Every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.
          ○ This interval is chosen to include both extreme values: cos(0) = 1 and cos(π) = −1.
     ◉ Interchange principle.
          ○ The restricted domain [0, π] becomes the range of the inverse function.
          ○ The original range [−1, 1] becomes the domain of the inverse.

     ◉ Key graphical properties.
          ○ The tangent function is periodic and has vertical asymptotes at odd multiples of π/2.
          ○ It fails the horizontal line test on ℝ 𝒅𝒖e to periodicity.
     ◉ Restriction to the open interval (−π/2, π/2) 𝒅𝒖e to vertical asymptotes.

     ◉ Range and inverse implications.
          ○ Range of tan(𝒙) on (−π/2, π/2): (−∞, ∞).
          ○ Therefore, the domain of tan⁻¹(𝒙) is (−∞, ∞).

     ◉ Definition and discontinuities.
          ○ csc(𝒙) = 1 / sin(𝒙).
          ○ csc(𝒙) is undefined where sin(𝒙) = 0 (𝒙 = 𝓀π, 𝓀 ∈ ℤ), pro𝒅𝒖cing vertical asymptotes.
     ◉ Graphical behavior.
          ○ The graph consists of separate branches above 1 and below −1.
          ○ It fails the horizontal line test on ℝ, so its inverse would not be a function unless the domain is restricted.

          ○ sec(𝒙) is undefined where cos(𝒙) = 0 (𝒙 = π/2 + 𝓀π), pro𝒅𝒖cing vertical asymptotes.
     ◉ Inverse function idea.
          ○ The domain must be restricted so sec(𝒙) becomes one-to-one.
          ○ Then sec⁻¹(𝒙) is defined using principal values on that restricted domain.

● [30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=1800). 🧩 Example – Evaluation of inverse trigonometric expressions using exact values: [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5/[30-00]-01.png)
     ◉ Key idea: evaluating an inverse trigonometric function means finding the angle 𝒚
        within the principal range such that the original trigonometric function equals
        the given value.
     ◉ Important restriction: the solution must lie inside the restricted interval of the
         inverse function, **not just any angle that satisfies the equation.**
     ◉ Evaluation of sin⁻¹(1/2)
          ○ Solve sin(𝒚) = 1/2.
          ○ The angle must satisfy 𝒚 ∈ [−π/2, π/2].
          ○ Therefore, sin⁻¹(1/2) = π/6.
     ◉ Evaluation of cos⁻¹(−√3/2)
          ○ Solve cos(𝒚) = −√3/2.
          ○ The angle must lie in the interval [0, π].
          ○ This places the angle in the second quadrant.
          ○ Hence, cos⁻¹(−√3/2) = 5π/6.
     ◉ Evaluation of tan⁻¹(√3)
          ○ Solve tan(𝒚) = √3.
          ○ The principal range is (−π/2, π/2).
          ○ Hence, tan⁻¹(√3) = π/3.
     ◉ Key warning:
          ○ Inverse trigonometric functions do NOT return all possible angles.
          ○ They return the unique angle within the principal interval.

     ◉  Evaluation of tan(cos⁻¹(1/2)).
          ○ Let θ = cos⁻¹(1/2).
          ○ Then cos θ = 1/2, with θ restricted to the principal range [0, π].
          ○ Right-triangle construction:
               ■ cos θ = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1/2
               ■ Choose adjacent = 1 and hypotenuse = 2
               ■ Opposite = √(2² − 1²) = √3
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ tan θ = opposite / adjacent = √3 / 1 = √3
               ■ tan(cos⁻¹(1/2)) = √3.

          ○ Let θ = sin⁻¹(1/3).
          ○ Then sin θ = 1/3, with θ in the principal range [−π/2, π/2].
          ○ Construct a right triangle:
               ■ Opposite side = 1
               ■ Hypotenuse = 3
               ■ Adjacent side = √(3² − 1²) = √8 = 2√2
          ○ Compute the cotangent:
               ■ cot θ = adjacent / opposite = 2√2 / 1
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ cot(sin⁻¹(1/3)) = 2√2.

● [46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=2760). Cancellation properties and the importance of domain restrictions. [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5/[46-00]-01.png)
     ◉ Direct cancellation (function composed with its inverse):
          ○ sin(sin⁻¹(𝒙)) = 𝒙,      for −1 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ 1
          ○ cos(cos⁻¹(𝒙)) = 𝒙,    for −1 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ 1
          ○ tan(tan⁻¹(𝒙)) = 𝒙,     for −∞ < 𝒙 < ∞
     ◉ Reverse cancellation (inverse composed with the function):
          ○ sin⁻¹(sin 𝒙) = 𝒙,       for −π/2 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ π/2
          ○ cos⁻¹(cos 𝒙) = 𝒙,     for 0 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ π
          ○ tan⁻¹(tan 𝒙) = 𝒙,      for −π/2 < 𝒙 < π/2
     ◉ Key idea:
          ○ The inverse does not “undo” the function everywhere — it only undoes it on the interval where the function is one-to-one.
          ○ Cancellation only works when the input lies in the restricted domain (principal interval) of the inverse function.
          ○ Outside these intervals, inverse trigonometric functions return the principal value, not the original angle.

     ◉ Key identity:
          ○ sin(sin⁻¹(𝒙)) = 𝒙
               ■ valid for −1 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ 1
     ◉ Domain check:
          ○ 0.3 ∈ [−1, 1] ✓
     ◉ Explanation:
          ○ sin⁻¹(𝒙) returns an angle whose sine is 𝒙.
          ○ Applying sin to that angle recovers the original value 𝒙.
          ○ Since 0.3 is within the domain of sin⁻¹, the cancellation is valid.
     ◉ Final result:
          ○ sin(sin⁻¹(0.3)) = 0.3

     ◉ Step 1: Evaluate the inner cosine
          ○ cos(3π/2) = 0
     ◉ Step 2: Rewrite the expression
          ○ cos⁻¹(cos(3π/2)) = cos⁻¹(0)
     ◉ Step 3: Interpret cos⁻¹(0)
          ○ Let θ = cos⁻¹(0)
          ○ This means: cos(θ) = 0
     ◉ Step 4: Apply the principal range of cos⁻¹
          ○ Range of cos⁻¹(𝒙) is [0, π]
          ○ In this interval, cos(θ) = 0 at:
               ■ θ = π/2
     ◉ Final result:
          ○ cos⁻¹(cos(3π/2)) = π/2

          ○ 𝑦 = sec⁻¹(𝒙)   ⇔   sec(𝑦) = 𝒙
     ◉ Step 2: Differentiate implicitly with respect to 𝒙
          ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝑥 [ sec(𝑦) ] = 𝒅/𝒅𝑥 [ 𝒙 ]
          ○ sec(𝑦) · tan(𝑦) · 𝒅𝑦/𝒅𝑥 = 1
     ◉ Step 3: Solve for 𝒅𝑦/𝒅𝑥
          ○ 𝒅𝑦/𝒅𝑥 = 1 / [ sec(𝑦) · tan(𝑦) ]
     ◉ Step 4: Express everything in terms of 𝒙
          ○ From sec(𝑦) = 𝒙
          ○ cos(𝑦) = 1/𝒙
     ◉ Step 5: Construct a right triangle

     ◉ Step 1 — Start with the chain rule formula:

          ○ (e⁻²𝒙)² = e⁻⁴𝒙 ⇒ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 =  −2e⁻²𝒙 / ( e⁻²𝒙 √(e⁻⁴𝒙 − 1) )
     ◉ Step 6 — Cancel e⁻²𝒙:
          ⇒ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = −2 / √(e⁻⁴𝒙 − 1)
     ◉ Final answer:
          ○ 𝒚' = − 2 / √(e⁻⁴𝒙 − 1)
     ◉ Domain check (important for sec⁻¹):
          ○ Need |e⁻²𝒙| ≥ 1
               ■ The inverse function sec⁻¹(𝒖) is defined only when:
                    ▣ |𝒖| ≥ 1
               ■ Why? Because:
                    ▣ sec 𝒙 = 1 / cos 𝒙
               ■ Since |cos 𝒙| ≤ 1, it follows that |sec 𝒙| ≥ 1.
               ■ Therefore, the natural domain of sec⁻¹(𝒖) is:
                    ▣ |𝒖| ≥ 1
          ○ e⁻²𝒙 ≥ 1 ⇔ −2𝒙 ≥ 0 ⇔ 𝒙 ≤ 0  
          ○ Valid domain: 𝒙 ≤ 0

     ◉ Step 1 — Chain rule (outer function cot):
          ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝑥[cot(𝒖)] = −csc²(𝒖) · 𝒅𝑢/𝒅𝑥
          ○ Let 𝒖 = cos⁻¹(𝒙²)
          ○ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = −csc²(cos⁻¹(𝒙²)) · 𝒅/𝒅𝑥[cos⁻¹(𝒙²)]
     ◉ Step 2 — Chain rule (inverse cosine):
          ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝑥[cos⁻¹(𝒗)] = −1/√(1−𝒗²) · d𝒗/𝒅𝑥
          ○ Here 𝒗 = 𝒙²  ⇒  d𝒗/𝒅𝑥 = 2𝒙
          ○ 𝒅/𝒅𝑥[cos⁻¹(𝒙²)] = −(1/√(1−(𝒙²)²)) · 2𝒙 = −2𝒙/√(1−𝒙⁴)
     ◉ Step 3 — Substitute back and simplify signs:
          ○ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = −csc²(cos⁻¹(𝒙²)) · (−2𝒙/√(1−𝒙⁴))
          ○ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = (2𝒙 · csc²(cos⁻¹(𝒙²))) / √(1−𝒙⁴)
     ◉ Step 4 — Triangle method to rewrite csc²(cos⁻¹(𝒙²)) in terms of 𝒙:
          ○ Let θ = cos⁻¹(𝒙²)  ⇔  cos θ = 𝒙²
          ○ In a right triangle take:
               ■ adjacent = 𝒙²
               ■ hypotenuse = 1
               ■ opposite = √(1−𝒙⁴)     (since 1² − (𝒙²)² = 1 − 𝒙⁴)
          ○ Then:
               ■ sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse = √(1−𝒙⁴)
               ■ csc θ = 1/sin θ = 1/√(1−𝒙⁴)
               ■ csc² θ = 1/(1−𝒙⁴)
          ○ Therefore:
               ■ csc²(cos⁻¹(𝒙²)) = 1/(1−𝒙⁴)
     ◉ Final answer:
          ○ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = (2𝒙/(1−𝒙⁴)) · 1/√(1−𝒙⁴)
          ○ 𝒅𝒚/𝒅𝑥 = 2𝒙 / (1−𝒙⁴)^(3/2)
     ◉ Domain note (real-valued):
          ○ The inner function is cos⁻¹(𝒙²), which is only defined when its input lies in [−1, 1].
          ○ Therefore we require:
               ■ 𝒙² ∈ [−1, 1]
          ○ Since 𝒙² is always non-negative, this re𝒅𝒖ces to:
               ■ 0 ≤ 𝒙² ≤ 1
          ○ Taking square roots gives:
               ■ |𝒙| ≤ 1
          ○ Hence the valid real domain for the original function is:
               ■ −1 ≤ 𝒙 ≤ 1
          ○ Additionally, the derivative contains √(1 − 𝒙⁴) in the denominator.
               ■ To avoid division by zero we must also have 1 − 𝒙⁴ > 0.
               ■ This again implies |𝒙| < 1 (strict inequality for the derivative).
          ○ Final practical domain for the derivative:
               ■ −1 < 𝒙 < 1

● NOTE: Triangle method simplification (Right Triangle Method)
     ◉ Core idea: represent the inverse angle with a right triangle.
          ○ Assign sides using the defining ratio of the inverse function.
          ○ Use Pythagoras to find the missing side.
          ○ Compute the desired trigonometric function from the triangle.
     ◉ Why this method is so useful (key point):
          ○ It avoids complicated algebraic manipulations.
          ○ It transforms abstract inverse-trig expressions into clear geometric relationships.
          ○ It provides an intuitive visual interpretation of the composition of functions.

     ◉ Fundamental inverse-trig integrals:
          ○ ∫ 1/√(1−𝒖²) 𝒅𝒖 = sin⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒  ;Works when |𝒖| ≤ 1.
          ○ ∫ 1/(1+𝒖²) 𝒅𝒖 = tan⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒  ;Valid for all real 𝒖.
          ○ ∫ 1/(𝒖√(𝒖²−1)) 𝒅𝒖 = sec⁻¹(|𝒖|) + 𝓒  ;Requires |𝒖| ≥ 1 (same restriction as sec⁻¹).
     ◉ Idea behind these formulas:
          ○ Many “complicated-looking” integrals can be transformed into one of these three forms by substitution.
          ○ Once matched, the result is immediately an inverse trigonometric function.
          ○ **We use only the positive formulas because the negative sign is absorbed in the substitution 𝒅𝒖; that is why we do not 
             need integration formulas involving cos⁻¹, cot⁻¹, or csc⁻¹ with a negative sign.**

● [1:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=5750). 🧩 Example – Integration by substitution leading to sin⁻¹(𝒖):  ∫ 1/√(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢 [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5/[1-35-50]-01.png) 
     ◉ Step 1 — Recognize the inverse-trig form  
          ○ The integrand resembles:
               ■ ∫ 1/√(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢  →  sin⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒  
          ○ Problem: the denominator contains 16𝒙², so it is not in standard form.
     ◉ Step 2 — Make a substitution  
          ○ Let 𝒖 = 4𝒙  
               ■ Then 𝒅𝑢 = 4 𝒅𝑥  
               ■ So 𝒅𝑥 = (1/4) 𝒅𝑢  
     ◉ Step 3 — Rewrite the integral in terms of 𝒖  
          ○ ∫ 1/√(1 − 16𝒙²) 𝒅𝑥  
          ○ = ∫ 1/√(1 − (4𝒙)²) · (1/4) 𝒅𝑢  
          ○ = (1/4) ∫ 1/√(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢  
     ◉ Step 4 — Apply the fundamental formula  
          ○ (1/4) ∫ 1/√(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢  
          ○ = (1/4) sin⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒  
     ◉ Step 5 — Back-substitute  
          ○ (1/4) sin⁻¹(4𝒙) + 𝓒  
     ◉ Key idea to remember  
          ○ The goal of the substitution is to **match exactly** the pattern 1/√(1 − 𝒖²)  so we can use the inverse sine formula directly.

     ◉ Step 1 — Factor the constant:
          ○ Rewrite:
               ■  ∫ 1 / √(25 − 𝒙²) 𝒅𝑥
               ■ = ∫ 1 / [5√(1 − (𝒙/5)²)] 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ Step 2 — 𝒖–substitution:
          ○ Let 𝒖 = 𝒙/5  
          ○ Then: 𝒅𝑢 = (1/5) 𝒅𝑥  ⇔  𝒅𝑥 = 5 𝒅𝑢
     ◉ Step 3 — Substitute into the integral:
          ○ ∫ 1 / [5√(1 − 𝒖²)] · 5 𝒅𝑢  
          ○ = ∫ 1 / √(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢  
     ◉ Step 4 — Apply the standard formula:
          ○ ∫ 1 / √(1 − 𝒖²) 𝒅𝑢 = sin⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒  
     ◉ Step 5 — Return to 𝒙:
          ○ sin⁻¹(𝒙/5) + 𝓒

● [1:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=6165). 🧩 Example –: ∫  e^𝒙 / (e^{2𝒙} + 1)  𝒅𝑥 [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5/[1-42-45]-01.png) 
     ◉ Step 1 — Rewrite to expose a perfect “something² + 1”:
          ○ e^{2𝒙} = (e^𝒙)²
          ○  ∫  e^𝒙 / (e^{2𝒙} + 1) 𝒅𝑥 = ∫  e^𝒙 / ((e^𝒙)² + 1) 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ Step 2 — Substitution:
          ○ Let 𝒖 = e^𝒙
          ○ Then 𝒅𝑢 = e^𝒙 𝒅𝑥
     ◉ Step 3 — Substitute:
          ○ ∫  e^𝒙 / ((e^𝒙)² + 1) 𝒅𝑥
               ■  ∫  1 / (𝒖² + 1) 𝒅𝑢
     ◉ Step 4 — Use the standard inverse trig antiderivative:
          ○ ∫ 1/(𝒖² + 1) 𝒅𝑢 = tan⁻¹(𝒖) + 𝓒
     ◉ Step 5 — Back-substitute:
          ○ tan⁻¹(e^𝒙) + 𝓒

● [1:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3ORfqVYQw&t=6418). 🧩 Example –: ∫ 1 / (𝒙√(9𝒙² − 1)) 𝒅𝑥 [📷image](../img/Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5/[1-46-58]-01.png) 
     ◉ Step 1 — Recognize structure:
          ○ Inside the root we have 9𝒙² − 1, which suggests something like √(𝒖² − 1)
     ◉ Step 2 — Choose substitution:
          ○ Let 𝒖 = 3𝒙
          ○ Then 𝒅𝑢 = 3 𝒅𝑥  ⇒  𝒅𝑥 = 𝒅𝑢 / 3
     ◉ Step 3 — Rewrite the integral in terms of 𝒖:
          ○ 𝒙 = 𝒖/3
          ○ √(9𝒙² − 1) = √(𝒖² − 1)
          ○ So the integral becomes:
               ■  ∫  1 / [ (𝒖/3) √(𝒖² − 1) ] · (𝒅𝑢/3)
     ◉ Step 4 — Simplify constants:
          ○ = ∫  1 / (𝒖 √(𝒖² − 1)) 𝒅𝑢
     ◉ Step 5 — Use standard formula:
          ○ ∫ 1 / (𝒖√(𝒖² − 1)) 𝒅𝑢 = sec⁻¹(|𝒖|) + 𝓒
     ◉ Step 6 — Back-substitute:
          ○ sec⁻¹(|3𝒙|) + 𝓒
